					It is of particular importance that seniors are diligent about their
					own healthcare, as they are usually the most at risk for complications
					and mistakes in emergency situations. On average, 1 in 2 adults over
					the age of 64 visits a hospital emergency room every year. Even more
					frightening, medical errors kill more than a quarter million people
					every year in the U.S. Between April and September of 2013, there were
					227,597 recorded medical accidents and errors in Quebecâ€™s Health
					Ministry. This small, six-month sample is a frightening insight into
					the larger picture. More than half of those incidents involved senior
					citizens.
